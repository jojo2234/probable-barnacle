<br><p><b>Project Description</b>
                
                    The project was born as an exercise for the exam of text encoding. The choosen text is a stretch from an article of Byte Magazine, 
                    December 1983, the text speak about a common matter of computer users, the power-line pollution. 
                    This inconvenience is a interference inside power line that could cause voltage anomalies, the consequence is damage to home computer. 
                    Infact in '80 years this problem was the principal cause of guaste in feeder. 
                    Steve Ciarcia in this article propose his solution.

                <p> A visitor once called the Circuit Cellar my
                        mountaintop wilderness retreat. Since he lived in the
                    center of Manhattan, the few oak and birch trees around my
                    house seemed to him like a forest, and because he could view scenery further
                    away than a block or two he must have felt like he was on Mount
                        Whitney. Well, my area is one of the higher points in
                        Connecticut, but that isn't very high. It's barely a
                    prairie-dog mound to someone from Montana. Life in a rural
                    location has its special pleasures. I get to plow the  snow from
                    my own driveway, trim back the ever-encroaching foliage and rake the leaves,
                    pile four cords of wood for the stove each winter (<a href="#refe1">see reference 1</a>), fight off
                    the local animal population, and spend large sums of money repairing damage done
                    to my electronic equipment by electrical disturbances. This last item is the
                    only one that really annoys me. Every year I can count on experiencing some
                    equipment failure attributable to an external electrical impulse, usually coming
                    in through the power line. </p>
                <p> For  three years, just like clockwork, the first thunderstorm in
                    June wiped out a DECwriter II terminal connected to one of my computers. After
                    the first two times of spending a few hours replacing blown chips, I got smart
                    and installed <i>sockets</i>. (Now I even know
                    in advance which chips will be blown.) Last summer I kept the printer
                    unconnected when I wasn't using it. But the elements were not to be denied.
                    During an August thunderstorm, lightning struck my house. I can't say for sure

                    tually hit (there were no burn marks or other visible clues),
                    but I suspect the point of entry was the power line. I remember seeing an
                    indistinct flash of light, hearing a tremendous crash, and then standing in
                    darkness. My assistant Jeanette saw a bright blue glow
                    behind one of the computers. Such a tremendous power surge is not kind to
                    semiconductor-based equipment. The casualties included one computer, one video
                    camera, two video monitors, a microwave receiver, and probably several other
                    assorted items I haven't found yet. The damage did not include the DECwriter
                    (safely unplugged since May), but it was over $3000. In December, thunderstorms
                    are not an immediate threat, but as I write this in early September the memory
                    is still fresh and I still have a month of potentially violent weather to
                    contend with. I am forced to consider some defensive measures. Perhaps by
                    relating my experiences I can save you from a similar fate. Of course, lightning
                    isn't the sole cause of electrical disturbances; you don't have to wait for a
                    thunderstorm to be a victim. Many kinds of trouble can be ducted into your
                    computer through the power line. In the January 1981
                    Circuit Cellar article (<a href="#refe2">reference 2</a>), I wrote about <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#intfM')">electromagnetic interference</span>

                    other forms of electrical pollution that occur on power lines. Afterward, I'll
                    describe a few simple, inexpensive means of dealing with them. </p>

                        forces and the connection or shedding of electrical loads. Your
                        susceptibility to these aberrations depends on your location in the
                        distribution system. If you are close to the power plant, you should have
                        relatively few, with the low <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#src-imp')">source-impedance</span> of the generator and short

                        But rural customers at the end of the line usually experience the full
                        effect. While the utilities try to distribute power evenly, the presence of
                        a large-scale user of electrical power along the line between the generator
                        and you can greatly affect the quality and quantity of the power you get. If
                        you own a personal computer, you should be concerned about the quality of
                        the power you feed it. Power-line irregularities cause problems for
                        computers and other digital equipment because certain kinds of extraneous
                        electrical pulses can be interpreted as data or instructions, causing errors
                        in operation. You face hazards every time you plug in a piece of electronic
                        equipment, but there are certain precautionary measures that can protect
                        your computer. The degree of sensitivity depends somewhat on the type of
                        equipment and the type of disturbances. As the operating speed of digital
                        equipment increases, its tolerance to power-line pollution lessens.
                        High-speed processors and memory components are susceptible to fast
                        transients. (Dynamic memories, which must be periodically refreshed, are
                        particularly susceptible.) Disk drives and displays, on the other hand, are
                        more affected by lasting surges and sags in operating voltage. </p>

                    <b>Common Sources of Woe</b>
                    <p> Electrical power-line disturbances can come from either natural or manmade
                        sources. Of the many ways the power line can be disturbed, the several
                        varieties of voltage fluctuation  most often cause problems
                        with computer equipment. These fluctuations can be categorized by source and
                        severity, as follows: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;"> Blackouts.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p> A blackout is a total power outage—the voltage goes to zero.
                                Obviously if no alternate source of power is available as a backup,
                                computer equipment will be severely affected, and data will be lost.
                                Blackouts generally affect only a small number of utility customers
                                (fewer than 5 percent) during a year and generally last less than 10
                                seconds. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Brownouts.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p> A brownout is typically a corrective action taken by the utility
                                when power demand exceeds generating capacity. The utility reduces
                                the output voltage from a <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#nomV')">nominal 120 V (volts)
                                    by 5 to 15 percent</span>. When the voltage is thus reduced, the
                                resistive load presented to the generators by the distribution
                                network consumes less power. Generally speaking, most consumer and
                                industrial equipment designed for use in North America
                                functions properly when supplied with current within the range from
                                105 to 130 V. But when operating at either extreme, the equipment is
                                more vulnerable to disruption from some other power-line anomaly.
                                Fortunately, power companies rarely reduce the voltage by more than
                                7 percent. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Voltage transients.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p> The phenomena of voltage transients include surges of voltage above
                                the specified normal, voltage sags below, and instantaneous voltage
                                spikes that leap far above the nominal levels. Surges and sags are
                                long-duration events occurring at some point in the distribution
                                network when electrical equipment is routinely turned on or off
                                nearby. The magnitude of the surge or sag depends upon the size of
                                the load being removed from or placed on the network. Sags are often
                                produced by the turning on of electric motors, which have high
                                starting currents. (You've probably noticed lights dimming

                <div class="introduction">
                    <p>A lightning flash is characterized by one or more strokes with typical peak
                        currents of 20 kA <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#kA')">(kiloamperes)</span> or higher. In the immediate vicinity of the
                        stroke's impact on the earth, hazardous voltage gradients exist. It is
                        difficult to establish a definite grounding-conductance
                        value necessary to protect equipment and personnel. The current in a
                        lightning strike is so high that even 1 ohm of resistance can theoretically
                        produce hazardous potentials. When lightning strikes a building unprotected
                        by a lightning rod, the stroke seeks out the lowest-impedance path to earth
                        (most likely through the electric wiring or water pipes).</p>

                    <b>How It Starts</b>
                    <p>As the electric charge builds up in a cloud, the electric field in the
                        vicinity of the charge center increases to the point where the air starts to
                        ionize. A column of ionized air, called a <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot streamer</span>, begins to extend
                        toward the earth at a velocity of about 100 miles per hour. After the <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot
                        streamer</span> has moved perhaps 100 feet to 150 feet, a more intense discharge
                        called the stepped leader occurs. This discharge inserts additional negative
                        cluzrge into the region around the <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot streamer</span> and allows the <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot
                        streamer</span> to advance for another 100 to 150 feet, after which the cycle
                        repeats. As its name indicates, the stepped leader progresses toward the
                        earth in a series of steps, with a time interval between steps on the order
                        of 50 microseconds. </p>
                    <p> In a cloud-to-ground flash, the <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot steamer</span> does not move in a direct line
                        toward the earth but instead follows the path through the atmosphere where
                        the air ionizes most readily. Although the general direction is toward the
                        earth, the specific angle of departure taken by each succeeding <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot
                        streamer</span> from the tip of the previous streamer is unpredictable. Therefore,
                        each 100- to 150-foot segment of the stroke will likely approach the earth
                        at a different angle. This changing angle of approach gives the overall
                        flash its characteristic zigzag appearance.</p>
                    <p> As a highly ionized column, the stepped leader is at essentially the same
                        potential as the charged area from which it originates. Thus, as the stepped
                        leader approaches the earth, the voltage gradient between the earth and the
                        tip of the leader increases. The increasing voltage further encourages the
                        air dielectric between the two regions to break down.</p>

                    <b>Attracting Lightning</b>
                    <p>Objects extending above their surroundings are likely to be struck by
                        lightning. Thin metallic structures, such as flag poles, lighting towers,
                        antennas, and overhead wires, offer a very small cross-sectional area
                        relative to the surrounding terrain, but ample evidence exists to show that
                        such objects apparently attract lightning. The ability of tall structures or
                        objects to attract lightning serves to protect shorter objects and
                        structures nearby. In effect, a tall object establishes a protected zone
                        around it; within this zone, other structures and objects are protected
                        against direct lightning strikes. As the height differential between the shorter surrounding objects and the tall
                        one decreases, the protection provided to the shorter objects decreases.
                        Likewise, as the horizontal distance between the tall and short structures
                        increases, the protection afforded by the tall structure decreases.</p>

                <div id="sez11" class="sezione">
                    <b>Lightning Rods</b>
                    <p>A protective device that makes use of this phenomenon is the lightning rod,
                        shown in photo. Generally just a sharp copper spike, the lightning rod is
                        attached to the highest point on the structure to be protected. When
                        lightning strikes, the current is shunted directly through a heavy copper
                        wire from the rod to a grounding electrode buried in the earth.
                        Although the duration of a strike is typically less than 2 microseconds, the
                        voltage generated is high enough to cause flashover strikes to conducting
                        objects located as much as 14 inches away from the conducting path. For this
                        reason, metallic objects in close proximity to down conductors should be
                        electrically bonded to the conductors.</p>
                    <p> But circuits not in direct contact with the lightning discharge path can
                        experience damage, even in the absence of overt coupling by flashover.
                        Because the high current associated with a discharge builds up so fast,
                        large inductively produced voltages are formed on nearby conductors.
                        Experimental and analytical evidence shows that the surges thus induced can
                        easily exceed the tolerance level of many components, particularly
                        solid-state devices. Inductive surges can be induced by lightning current
                        flowing in a down conductor or structural member, by a stroke to earth in
                        the vicinity of buried cables, or by cloud-to-cloud discharges occurring
                        parallel to long cable runs, either above ground or buried.</p>

                    <b>The Moral</b>
                    <p>The objective of all lightning-protection systems is to direct the high
                        currents away from susceptible elements or limit the voltage gradients
                        developed by the high current to safe levels. In a given area, certain
                        structures or objects are more likely to be struck by lightning than others;
                        however, no object, whether man-made or natural, should be assumed to be
                        immune from lightning. The voltages that could be induced by such discharges
                        present a definite threat to signal and control equipment, particularly
                        equipment employing semiconductor components.</p>

                            <p> Surges are generally the result of network switching by the utility
                                or of a sudden reduction in demand for power in the network; during
                                the period necessary for the utility's electromechanical
                                compensation system to function, an overvoltage transient condition
                                can exist. The most damaging power-line disturbance is the
                                high-speed, highenergy voltage spike. People speaking  loosely about "power-line transients" are probably
                                talking about this type of event. Lasting usually less than 100
                                microseconds, spikes can be up to 6000 volts. Such high-energy
                                transients are produced by the switching off of inductive loads by
                                the opening of switch contacts, short circuits, or blown fuses;
                                severe network load changes; or lightning. Inductive-load switching
                                accounts for the majority of spikes. </p>

                            <p> When the coil of an inductive load such as a transformer or motor is
                                suddenly deenergized, the collapsing magnetic field must dissipate
                                its energy, and it does this by placing a large voltage back into
                                the circuit that energized it. Let's examine the process in detail.
                                As the circuit through the inductor is broken, current in the
                                inductor continues to flow, charging the distributed capacitance in
                                the windings. At some point, the charge voltage becomes sufficient
                                to leap across the switch gap as a spark. This sudden shorting
                                action discharges the winding's capacitive charge back into the
                                circuit until the spark ceases. This process repeats in a cycle
                                until there is too little energy left in the coil to create an arc
                                across the contacts. The waveform of inductance-generated transients
                                is oscillatory. For example, a contact opening while conducting 100
                                mA <i>(milliamperes)</i> in a 1-H
                                    <i>(henry)</i> inductance
                                will produce a 3000-V spike, assuming about a 0.001-µtF <i>(microfarad)</i> stray winding
                                capacitance. Whenever you plug in a vacuum cleaner, hair drier, or
                                other appliance (even your computer), you could be creating some
                                potentially serious transient disruptions for other equipment on the
                                same power line. The equipment need not even be on the same wiring
                                circuit. The capacitance of household wiring is often sufficient to
                                couple a transient from one wire to another <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#diffMode')">(differential mode)</span> or from the wire to the ground <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#commMode')">(common mode)</span>. Lightning is the most
                                violent and most destructive source of transient energy. A direct
                                lightning hit is catastrophic, but direct hits seldom occur. A more
                                frequent danger is that a lightning strike on a power line miles
                                away may result in a thousandvolt spike rushing throughout your
                                home. Such hits happen frequently enough to cause much grief.</p>

                        suppress their voltages to a harmless level, either with filters or a
                        special category of components called <i> transient suppressors.</i>

                    <b>Power-Line Filters</b>
                    <p> A power-line interference filter is an electronic circuit used to control

The filter is intended to
                        provide unwanted interference signals with a high series impedance (into the
                        vulnerable equipment) and low shunt impedance (to ground). It generally
                        consists of a set of passive components that act as a mismatching network
                        for high-frequency signals-a low-pass filter. The network attenuates <abbr title="Radio Frequency">RF</abbr><span class="expan">Radio Frequency</span>
                        energy above 10 kHz, while passing the 60-Hz power.</p>
                    <p> The simplest possible filter is a single capacitor wired in parallel or  a single coil wired in series with the power line. More
                        typically, several <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#cond')">capacitors</span> and/or coils are
                        used together, connected into different configurations variously called L,

                        predict these impedances for all applications, it is not possible to
                        unequivocally state that a specific filter configuration will work the same

                        however, resistive source and load impedances of 50 ohms each are generally
                        used. Two similar power-line filters, even built with the same circuit
                        topology and component values, may not perform identically; the mounting and
                        wiring of the filter can be critical influences on its performance. A
                        power-line filter is best installed at the point in your equipment where the
                        power line comes inside the case rather than at the far end of a long cord.
                        The filter's purpose is to attenuate high-frequency signals: this purpose is
                        defeated if these parasitic signals can gain access to the equipment by
                        capacitively coupling to the power cord at a point behind the filter. It's

                        the best location for a power-line filter is bolted to the chassis of the
                        electronic equipment it protects, or at least in the immediate vicinity,
                        such as at the power receptacle. While you could construct a line filter
                        using the formulas and designs from a magazine article, I heartily recommend
                        that you buy a packaged unit instead.</p>

                        depends upon component selection and layout that the only way to make sure
                        power-line interference has been eliminated is to actually test the filter
                        in your equipment.  A circuit designed according to theory

                    <b>Transient Suppressors</b>
                    <p> Protection from. the various kinds of line transients is obtained by
                        suppressing or diverting them. The three types of circuits most often used
                        for this are filters, <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#crowB')">crowbars</span>, and <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#VolClamp')">voltage-clampers</span>. As I previously alluded,
                        filters comprising inductances and capacitances are widely used for
                        interference protection, including transients. Since most transient signals
                        are high frequency, the suppression by a filter is often effective, provided
                        it can withstand the associated high voltages.</p>
                    <p> Crowbar circuits use a switching action, such as turning on a thyristor or
                        arcing across a spark gap, to divert transients. But <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#crowB')">crowbars</span> that

                    <p> Voltage-clamping devices, on the other hand, have impedances that vary as a
                        function of either the voltage across or the current through them. The
                        circuit being protected is unaffected by the presence of the clamping device
                        unless the incoming supply voltage exceeds the clamping level, as would be
                        the case when a transient hits. The various kinds of high-speed
                        voltage-clamping devices include selenium cells, zener diodes,
                        silicon-carbide varistors, and metaloxide varistors. Of these, the

                    <p>Metal-Oxide Varistors are voltagedependent nonlinear devices that behave
                        somewhat like a back-biased zener diode. When a voltage lower than its
                        conduction threshold is applied across it, the <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistor">MOV</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistor</span> appears as a
                        nonconducting open circuit. But if the applied voltage becomes greater than
                        this set point (when a transient hits), the <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistor">MOV</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistor</span> begins to conduct, clamping
                        the input voltage to a safe level. In effect, the <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistor">MOV</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistor</span> absorbs the transient
                        and dissipates the energy as heat.</p>
                    <p> An <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistor">MOV</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistor</span> is made of zinc oxide combined with small amounts of bismuth, cobalt,
                        and manganese. The individual zinc-oxide grains form many p/n
                        (positive-doped/negativedoped) junctions that combine in a multitude of
                        series and parallel arrangements. This diversity of microstructure causes
                        its nonlinear semiconducting characteristics. An <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistor">MOV</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistor</span> is inherently more
                        rugged than a single-junction semiconductor device (a zener diode, for
                        example) because energy is uniformly absorbed throughout the bulk of the
                        component.</p>
                    <p> The physical dimensions of the <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistor">MOV</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistor</span> determine its characteristics, its

                    <b>Protect Your Computer</b>
                    <p>Large companies sometimes solve power-line problems by producing their own
                        power. In the home or small office, it's more practical to protect your
                        computer and peripherals through comprehensive application of filtering and
                        transient suppression. Most of the commercially available filtered power
                        strips contain <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistors">MOVs</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistors</span> as their primary suppression device. Even those costing
                        $50 or $75 rarely contain more than $5 worth of transient protection. By
                        purchasing the suppression components separately and installing them
                        yourself, you can save a lot of money.The majority of the
                        projects I've presented in Circuit Cellar articles can be built
                        for $50 to $2000, but the project this month wins hands down for economy.
                        For the most part, line filters and <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistors">MOVs</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistors</span> are available off the shelf, and
                        adequate transient suppression for your computer might cost as little as
                        $1.59!</p>
                    <p> You can take two approaches in installing suppression. If you are interested
                        in protecting only a few items of equipment, <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistors">MOVs</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistors</span> can be wired across the AC
                        line where it enters the enclosures. You can find the General Electric
                        V130LA10A <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistor">MOV</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistor</span> component at Radio Shack for $1.59 (stock number 276-570).
                        This device is ideally suited to 120-VAC applications. It has an energy
                        rating of 38 joules (watt-seconds) and will clamp to 340 V at 50 A within 35

                        power-line filters at Radio Shack for $11.95 (stock number 273-100). These
                        units, like the one shown in <a href="./img/fig1.png">photo 1</a>, are adequate for most consumer
                        applications and fit in very nicely with existing equipment.)</p>
                    <p> The easier alternative is to modify a regular power strip to include
                        transient suppression. Radio Shack's 4- outlet strip (number 61-2620,
                        costing $15.95) is perfect for this application. Merely open it up and
                        install three <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistors">MOVs</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistors</span>, as demonstrated in the series of photos 2 through 6,
                        connected as shown in <a href="./img/fig1.png">figure 1
                        </a>. One <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistor">MOV</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistor</span> is installed directly between the black (hot) and
                        white (neutral) leads, the second <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistor">MOV</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistor</span> is connected from the black lead to
                        the green (ground) wire, and the third from the white to the green. While
                        you might squeak through by installing one <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistor">MOV</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistor</span> across the line, complete
                        <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#commMode')">common-mode</span> and <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#diffMode')">differential-mode</span> suppression requires three <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistors">MOVs</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistors</span>. (<a href="./img/fig7.png">Photo 7</a> shows a
                        commercial adaptation of the simplified scheme.) The price for all the parts
                        of the protected power strip is $20.72. If you were to buy a larger power
                        strip or build your own distribution box, you could also add a power-line
                        filter. And if you have a filter strip already on your computer, you might
                        want to check its degree of transient protection (see <a href="./img/fig8.png">photo 8</a>).</p>

                    <b>An Ounce of Prevention...</b>
                    <p>This project may not seem very exciting. I didn't find the idea very
                        exciting, either, until the flash and subsequent smoke coming out of my
                        favorite article-writing computer provided all the excitement I'll need for
                        months. Most of the $3000 worth of damage I had was for equipment plugged
                        into a single circuit, some of it on the same power strip. I had always
                        known the protective value of <abbr title="Metal Oxide Varisistors">MOVs</abbr><span class="expan">Metal Oxide Varisistors</span>, but I thought it wouldn't happen to me.
                        A few dollars' worth of parts could have saved a lot of aggravation. Voltage
                        spikes and power-line disturbances aren't always the result of storm
                        activity. Transient-caused equipment failures can happen any-time.</p>
                    <p>The events I've described just served as a catalyst for presenting the
                        subject. And even if lightning never hits you, you should know that many of
                        the new computers I have been evaluating this year have shown an increased
                        sensitivity to external interferance, including power-line <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#gltch')">glitches</span>. You
                        wouldn't want to find your new computer rebooting suddenly at a critical
                        point or discover the memory to be scrambled after you plug in a printer on
                        the same outlet. Transient suppression constitutes an ounce of prevention.
                        You can spend thousands for the cure. </p>

                <h3>How Lightning Strikes</h3>
                <div class="introduction">
                    <p>A lightning flash is characterized by one or more strokes with typical peak
                        currents of 20 kA <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#kA')">(kiloamperes)</span> or higher. In the immediate vicinity of the
                        stroke's impact on the earth, hazardous voltage gradients exist. It is
                        difficult to establish a definite grounding-conductance
                        value necessary to protect equipment and personnel. The current in a
                        lightning strike is so high that even 1 ohm of resistance can theoretically
                        produce hazardous potentials. When lightning strikes a building unprotected
                        by a lightning rod, the stroke seeks out the lowest-impedance path to earth
                        (most likely through the electric wiring or water pipes).</p>

                    <b>How It Starts</b>
                    <p>As the electric charge builds up in a cloud, the electric field in the
                        vicinity of the charge center increases to the point where the air starts to
                        ionize. A column of ionized air, called a <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot streamer</span>, begins to extend
                        toward the earth at a velocity of about 100 miles per hour. After the <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot
                        streamer</span> has moved perhaps 100 feet to 150 feet, a more intense discharge
                        called the stepped leader occurs. This discharge inserts additional negative
                        cluzrge into the region around the <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot streamer</span> and allows the <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot
                        streamer</span> to advance for another 100 to 150 feet, after which the cycle
                        repeats. As its name indicates, the stepped leader progresses toward the
                        earth in a series of steps, with a time interval between steps on the order
                        of 50 microseconds. </p>
                    <p> In a cloud-to-ground flash, the <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot steamer</span> does not move in a direct line
                        toward the earth but instead follows the path through the atmosphere where
                        the air ionizes most readily. Although the general direction is toward the
                        earth, the specific angle of departure taken by each succeeding <span class="glossOver" onclick="showGloss('#pltStamr')">pilot
                        streamer</span> from the tip of the previous streamer is unpredictable. Therefore,
                        each 100- to 150-foot segment of the stroke will likely approach the earth
                        at a different angle. This changing angle of approach gives the overall
                        flash its characteristic zigzag appearance.</p>
                    <p> As a highly ionized column, the stepped leader is at essentially the same
                        potential as the charged area from which it originates. Thus, as the stepped
                        leader approaches the earth, the voltage gradient between the earth and the
                        tip of the leader increases. The increasing voltage further encourages the
                        air dielectric between the two regions to break down.</p>

                    <b>Attracting Lightning</b>
                    <p>Objects extending above their surroundings are likely to be struck by
                        lightning. Thin metallic structures, such as flag poles, lighting towers,
                        antennas, and overhead wires, offer a very small cross-sectional area
                        relative to the surrounding terrain, but ample evidence exists to show that
                        such objects apparently attract lightning. The ability of tall structures or
                        objects to attract lightning serves to protect shorter objects and
                        structures nearby. In effect, a tall object establishes a protected zone
                        around it; within this zone, other structures and objects are protected
                        against direct lightning strikes. As the height differential between the shorter surrounding objects and the tall
                        one decreases, the protection provided to the shorter objects decreases.
                        Likewise, as the horizontal distance between the tall and short structures
                        increases, the protection afforded by the tall structure decreases.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="sez11" class="sezione">
                    <b>Lightning Rods</b>
                    <p>A protective device that makes use of this phenomenon is the lightning rod,
                        shown in photo. Generally just a sharp copper spike, the lightning rod is
                        attached to the highest point on the structure to be protected. When
                        lightning strikes, the current is shunted directly through a heavy copper
                        wire from the rod to a grounding electrode buried in the earth.
                        Although the duration of a strike is typically less than 2 microseconds, the
                        voltage generated is high enough to cause flashover strikes to conducting
                        objects located as much as 14 inches away from the conducting path. For this
                        reason, metallic objects in close proximity to down conductors should be
                        electrically bonded to the conductors.</p>
                    <p> But circuits not in direct contact with the lightning discharge path can
                        experience damage, even in the absence of overt coupling by flashover.
                        Because the high current associated with a discharge builds up so fast,
                        large inductively produced voltages are formed on nearby conductors.
                        Experimental and analytical evidence shows that the surges thus induced can
                        easily exceed the tolerance level of many components, particularly
                        solid-state devices. Inductive surges can be induced by lightning current
                        flowing in a down conductor or structural member, by a stroke to earth in
                        the vicinity of buried cables, or by cloud-to-cloud discharges occurring
                        parallel to long cable runs, either above ground or buried.</p>

                    <b>The Moral</b>
                    <p>The objective of all lightning-protection systems is to direct the high
                        currents away from susceptible elements or limit the voltage gradients
                        developed by the high current to safe levels. In a given area, certain
                        structures or objects are more likely to be struck by lightning than others;
                        however, no object, whether man-made or natural, should be assumed to be
                        immune from lightning. The voltages that could be induced by such discharges
                        present a definite threat to signal and control equipment, particularly
                        equipment employing semiconductor components.</p>
